## What is This?

Sams Product OS is an AI-powered personal operating system to organize my PM workspace

- **Three-Bucket Workflow** - Backlog → Active → Archive keeps you focused
- **Backlog Processing** - Brain dump → Organized tasks/initiatives
- **Document Generation** - Specs, briefs, PRDs from conversation
- **Research Synthesis** - Transform interviews into insights
- **Voice Training** - Match your writing style

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samkawsarani/sams-product-os.git
cd sams-product-os
```

### 2. Prerequisites

- **macOS**: Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) — the setup script handles the rest
- **Node.js / npm**: Required for [QMD](https://github.com/tobi/qmd) search — install via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- **Other platforms**: Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) manually

### 3. Run Setup

```bash
./setup.sh
```

The interactive setup will install dependencies (including [QMD](https://github.com/tobi/qmd) for fast knowledge base search), create your workspace, configure MCP, and verify everything works. It will also walk you through optional Cursor setup and plugin installation.

### 4. Start Using It

**Brain dump to `tasks/BACKLOG.md`:**
```markdown
## Product
- Follow up with Sarah about Q4 goals

## Strategy
- Mobile Performance Issues
  - Source: Support tickets (15 this week)
  - Context: Android app slow on startup
```

**Process your backlog:**
```
/process-backlog
```

AI categorizes into:
- **Tasks** → stay in `tasks/BACKLOG.md` (organized under topic headers)
- **Initiatives** → `initiatives/` (strategic ideas to explore)
- **References** → `knowledge/references/` (useful context)

**Plan your week:**

Move items from `tasks/BACKLOG.md` into `tasks/ACTIVE.md`:
- **In Progress** — working on now
- **Up Next** — committed this week
- **Waiting On** — blocked on someone else

## Context Setup

The `knowledge/` folder is your AI's long-term memory. It has two types of content:

### Reference Context (set up by you)

Files you create once and update as things change. The AI reads these to understand who you are, how your team works, and what your strategy is.

| Folder | What to put there |
|--------|-------------------|
| `about-me/` | Role, background, working style, strengths |
| `company-context/` | Mission, products, team, org structure |
| `product-strategy/` | Vision, strategic pillars, roadmap, OKRs |
| `frameworks/` | PM methodologies you use (RICE, JTBD, etc.) |
| `processes/` | How your team works, sprint cadence, decision-making |
| `references/` | Competitive research, articles, open requests |
| `voice-samples/` | Writing samples for style matching (see [Voice Training](#voice-training)) |
| `decisions/` | Decision log — one file per significant decision |

AI reads files in priority order: `about-me/` → `product-strategy/` → `company-context/` → `frameworks/` → task-relevant folders.

Reference files explicitly with `@knowledge/product-strategy/current-strategy.md`.

### Domain Learning (maintained by your agent)

As you work, your agent builds up learned knowledge in domain-specific folders (e.g., `knowledge/interac/`, `knowledge/checkout-flow/`). Each domain folder holds three files: `knowledge.md` (facts), `hypotheses.md` (patterns under observation), and `rules.md` (confirmed — applied by default). The agent creates these automatically; you never pre-populate them. See `knowledge/AGENTS.md` for the full knowledge architecture and maintenance rules.

See `knowledge/INDEX.md` for a directory of what's in your knowledge folder.

---

## What Gets Committed vs. Gitignored

**Committed (shared structure):**
- Directory structure
- Documentation, templates, `.claude/skills/`
- `evals/` folder (automated tests)
- `.claude/skills/` folder (AI agent capabilities)
- `AGENTS.md` and subdirectory `AGENTS.md` + `CLAUDE.md` files (agent instructions for each folder)

**Gitignored (your data):**
- `tasks/BACKLOG.md`
- `tasks/ACTIVE.md`
- `tasks/_archived/`
- `GOALS.md`
- `VOICE-GUIDE.md`
- Content in `knowledge/`, `tasks/`, `meetings/`, `initiatives/`, `_temp/`

---

## Core Workflow

```
tasks/BACKLOG.md → /process-backlog → Tasks (stay in backlog) / Initiatives / References
                 → weekly planning → tasks/ACTIVE.md → tasks/_archived/YYYY-MM.md
```

1. **Brain dump** to `tasks/BACKLOG.md` throughout the day
2. **Process** with `/process-backlog` — AI classifies items, creates initiative and reference files
3. **Plan** — Move items into `tasks/ACTIVE.md` for the week: In Progress, Up Next, Waiting On
4. **Archive** — Log completed work to `tasks/_archived/YYYY-MM.md` during weekly review

---

## Tasks

### Three-Bucket System

Tasks live in three files — no individual task files, no frontmatter, no priority codes.

**`tasks/BACKLOG.md`** — Brain dump inbox. Bullets organized by topic header. Not committed work yet.
```markdown
## Product
- Follow up with Sarah about Q4 goals

## Strategy
- Research competitive pricing changes
```

**`tasks/ACTIVE.md`** — This week's focus. Three sections:
```markdown
# Active — Week of Apr 7–11
**Focus:** Ship the pricing experiment

## In Progress
- [ ] Review PRD draft with eng lead

## Up Next
- [ ] Schedule merchant feedback call

## Waiting On
| Who | What | Since | Next step |
|-----|------|-------|-----------|
| Legal | Contract review | Apr 8 | Follow up if no word by Apr 10 |
```

**`tasks/_archived/YYYY-MM.md`** — Monthly retrospective. Logged at week-end.
```markdown
## Week of Apr 7–11

### Shipped
- Pricing experiment launched to 10% of users

### Completed
- PRD draft reviewed and approved
```

### Managing Tasks

**Daily:**
- "What am I working on?" → `/view-tasks` (shows ACTIVE.md)
- "Show my backlog" → `/view-tasks backlog`
- Brain dump into `tasks/BACKLOG.md` under the appropriate header

**Weekly:**
- `/process-backlog` — classify and clean the backlog
- `/weekly-review` — review progress, plan next week, log to archive
- `/daily-pulse` — morning briefing with calendar + active tasks

---

## Skills

This is the base project with core skills built in. Install additional skills from the plugin marketplace to extend your capabilities.

### Built-in Skills

**View Tasks (`view-tasks` skill):**
- `/view-tasks` or `/view-tasks active`: show `tasks/ACTIVE.md` (default)
- `/view-tasks backlog`: show `tasks/BACKLOG.md`
- `/view-tasks archive`: browse `tasks/_archived/`

**Process Backlog (`process-backlog` skill):**
- Process `tasks/BACKLOG.md` into organized tasks, initiatives, references
- Deduplication and goal-alignment checks

**Daily Pulse (`daily-pulse` skill):**
- `/daily-pulse`: morning briefing — calendar + active task priorities
- `/daily-pulse tomorrow`: tomorrow look-ahead
- `/daily-pulse week`: week overview

**Weekly Review (`weekly-review` skill):**
- `/weekly-review`: reflect on past week, plan next week, log to archive
- `/weekly-review quick`: condensed version

### Plugin Marketplace

Browse and install additional skills (analytics, grooming, research, writing, and more) from the [Sams Product Plugins](https://github.com/samkawsarani/sams-product-plugins) marketplace.

**Add the marketplace:**
```
/plugin marketplace add samkawsarani/sams-product-plugins
```

**Install a plugin:**
```
/plugin install {PLUGIN-NAME}@sams-product-plugins
```

---

## MCP Servers (Optional)

MCP (Model Context Protocol) provides direct tool access for faster operations.

### Task Manager MCP

For faster backlog operations:

```bash
uv sync
```

Configure your AI assistant to use `tools/mcp-servers/task-manager/server.py` (see `tools/mcp-servers/task-manager/README.md`).

**Provides 3 tools:**
- `process_backlog` — classify items from `tasks/BACKLOG.md` (tasks / initiatives / references)
- `clear_backlog` — reset `tasks/BACKLOG.md` to blank template
- `check_duplicates` — fuzzy-match a title against existing items in backlog, active, and initiatives

---

## Common Commands

**Daily:**
- `/daily-pulse` — Morning briefing: calendar + active tasks
- `/view-tasks` — Show ACTIVE.md
- Brain dump into `tasks/BACKLOG.md`

**Weekly:**
- `/process-backlog` — Classify and clean the backlog
- `/weekly-review` — Reflect, plan, archive

**Natural language works too:**
- "What am I working on?" → shows ACTIVE.md
- "What's in my backlog?" → shows BACKLOG.md
- "Add [item] to my backlog" → adds to BACKLOG.md under appropriate header

---

## Voice Training

Give AI examples of your actual writing, then have it extract patterns and apply them.
### Step 1: Collect Your Writing Samples

Gather 5-10 examples of your real writing. Mix of formats works best:

```
knowledge/
├── voice-samples/
│   ├── email-to-colleague.md
│   ├── email-to-exec.md
│   ├── slack-messages.md
│   ├── linkedin-post.md
│   ├── blog-post-excerpt.md
│   └── product-spec-intro.md
```

**What makes good samples:**

- Emails you actually sent (not templates)
- Slack messages that got good responses
- Posts that felt authentically "you"
- Writing you're proud of

**What to avoid:**

- Heavily edited/formal documents
- Writing you copied from somewhere
- Samples that don't represent your natural style

### Step 2: Run Voice Analysis

Ask your agent to analyze your samples:

```
Read all files in knowledge/voice-samples/ and analyze my writing style.
Extract specific patterns for:
1. Sentence structure and length
2. How I open and close messages
3. Words/phrases I use often
4. What I never say
5. Tone and formality level
6. How I structure arguments

Create a voice guide.
```

### Step 3: Review the Voice Guide
Your agent will produce something like:

```md
## Your Writing Voice

### Sentence Style
- Short sentences. Punchy. You rarely go over 15 words.
- Questions used to transition: "So what does this mean?"
- Em dashes avoided - you use commas or periods instead

### Openers
- Emails: Jump straight to the point, no "Hope you're well"
- Posts: Lead with a surprising fact or bold claim
- Specs: Start with the user problem, not the solution

### Signature Phrases
- "Here's the thing..."
- "Let's be real"
- "The short version:"
- Ends with clear next step or question

### What You Avoid
- "I hope this email finds you well"
- "Please don't hesitate to reach out"
- Bullet point lists in emails (prefer paragraphs)
- Emojis in professional context
- "Key insights" or "learnings"

### Tone Calibration
- To peers: Casual, direct, occasional humor
- To execs: Concise, data-first, clear ask
- Public posts: Confident but not salesy
```

### Step 4: Save It (Optional)

**Option A: Save to VOICE-GUIDE.md** (faster, more consistent)
```
Save this to VOICE-GUIDE.md in the project root.
```
This file is gitignored. The agent automatically checks for it when drafting content.

**Option B: Skip saving** (simpler, always fresh)
Let the agent read from `knowledge/voice-samples/` each time you ask it to match your voice.

### Step 5: Test and Refine
```
Draft an email to my VP about pushing the launch date back one week.
Match my voice from VOICE-GUIDE.md (or knowledge/voice-samples/).
```

Compare the output to how you'd actually write it. Give feedback:

```
Good start, but I wouldn't say "I wanted to reach out" - I'd just say
"Quick update on launch timing." Also too many bullet points, I usually
write in short paragraphs. Try again.
```

**Maintenance**: Add new samples monthly as your voice evolves.
```
Read my recent writing in [location] and update my voice guide.
What patterns have changed? What's new?
```

## Best Practices

**Daily:**
- Brain dump to `tasks/BACKLOG.md` throughout the day
- `/view-tasks` to check what's active

**Weekly:**
- `/process-backlog` to classify and clean
- `/weekly-review` to reflect, plan, and archive
- Update `tasks/ACTIVE.md` at the start of each week

**Context:**
- Start small — add context as you go
- Update voice samples quarterly

**Tips:**
- Use @ mentions: `@knowledge/product-strategy/`
- Process 3-5 backlog items at a time, not 50
- Keep ACTIVE.md focused — if you can't finish it this week, it belongs in the backlog
- Install additional skills from the plugin marketplace

**Troubleshooting:**
- Generic responses? Add more to `knowledge/`
- AI not using context? Use @ mentions explicitly
- Overwhelmed by backlog? `/process-backlog` to declutter

## Running Evals

Test that your system is working correctly after making changes:

```bash
uv run pytest evals/ -v
```

This validates:
- Backlog item classification (task / initiative / reference)
- Deduplication behavior
- Agent instruction structure (progressive disclosure across AGENTS.md files)
- Skill behavior contracts

See `evals/README.md` for details.
