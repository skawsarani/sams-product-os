## Troubleshooting

### Tutorial Issues

**"AI isn't following the tutorial steps"**
- Reference the tutorial file explicitly: `@examples/tutorials/01-getting-started.md`
- Quote specific sections
- Break into smaller steps

**"Examples don't match my product"**
- That's OK! Adapt examples to your context
- Focus on the format/structure
- Replace domain-specific content

**"Taking longer than time estimate"**
- Time estimates assume familiarity with concepts
- First time through may take 2x longer
- Speed improves with practice

### Getting Stuck

**Where to Get Help**:
1. Check `examples/example_files/` for concrete examples
2. Review `examples/workflows/README.md` for detailed workflows
3. Read `GETTING-STARTED.md` for setup issues
4. Check style guidance in `AGENTS.md`

**Common Mistakes**:
- Skipping context setup (Tutorial 1 & 3)
- Not using @ mentions to reference files
- Trying advanced workflows before basics
- Not personalizing to your domain
