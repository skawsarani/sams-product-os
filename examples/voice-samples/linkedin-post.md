## Actual Post

**Just shipped a mobile redesign that took 6 months. Here's what I'd do differently:**

1. **Ship in 2-week chunks, not one big bang**

We built everything, then launched. Risky and stressful. Next time: MVP in week 2, iterate weekly from there.

2. **Put real user data in staging**

We tested with lorem ipsum. Users test with their actual messy data. Guess which found more bugs?

3. **Launch to 10% of users first**

Full launch Day 1 meant when we found issues, everyone saw them. Phased rollout lets you catch problems at small scale.

4. **Talk to support before launch, not after**

They know every edge case customers hit. 30-minute chat could have saved us 3 late-night bug fixes.

5. **Document decisions in public**

We had great internal discussions. Then someone asked "why did we choose X?" and no one remembered. Write it down.

**What would you add? What's your biggest launch lesson?**
