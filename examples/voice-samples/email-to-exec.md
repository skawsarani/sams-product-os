## Actual Email

**Subject**: Q4 Launch - Recommend 1-week delay

Sarah,

Recommending we push the Q4 mobile launch from Nov 15 → Nov 22.

**Why**: Performance testing shows load times 40% above target on Android. Affects 35% of our user base. High risk of poor reviews and support load.

**Trade-off**: 
- Pro: Ship quality experience, avoid support fire drill
- Con: Miss end-of-quarter deadline, delay revenue by ~$50K

**Decision needed**: Approve delay or ship with known issue and fast-follow patch.

I recommend delay. One week lets us fix root cause vs. band-aid.

Your call - happy to discuss at our 1:1 tomorrow or can decide now.

Sam
