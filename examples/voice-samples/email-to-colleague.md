## Actual Email

**Subject**: Mobile redesign - pushing to next sprint

Hey Alex,

Quick heads up on the mobile redesign. We're pushing it to next sprint.

Here's why: QA found 3 P0 bugs in the checkout flow yesterday. Need to ship fixes before we can start redesign work. Makes more sense to do it right than rush it.

New timeline:
- Bugs fixed by Friday
- Redesign starts Monday
- Should still hit our Q1 launch date

Let me know if this breaks anything on your end. Can chat more at standup tomorrow if you want.

Sam
