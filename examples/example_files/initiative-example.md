# Initiative: Mobile Performance Optimization

**Status**: Evaluating  
**Priority**: P1  
**Owner**: [PM Name]  
**Created**: 2024-12-01

## Objective

Improve mobile app performance to reduce crashes and increase conversion rates for mobile users.

**Problem Statement**: Mobile users (20% of our user base) are experiencing crashes and slow load times, particularly on Android 12 devices. This is impacting conversion rates and generating support tickets.

## Target Customer

### Primary
- **Mobile-first users** (67% Android, 33% iOS)
- **Frequent users** (3+ times per week)
- **Checkout flow users** (where performance issues are most critical)

### Secondary
- **New users** (first impressions matter)
- **Enterprise customers** with field teams using mobile

### User Personas
- **Sarah, Field Sales Rep**: Uses app on-the-go for demos
- **Mike, Frequent Buyer**: Shops exclusively on mobile during commute
- **Enterprise Admin**: Manages team access via mobile

## What We Know

### Evidence & Data

**Usage Data**:
- 20% of users are mobile (growing 15% MoM)
- Mobile conversion: 62% vs desktop 78%
- 45 support tickets/week related to mobile performance

**Crash Analytics**:
- 80% of crashes on Android 12
- Most crashes during: checkout (40%), image upload (30%), search (20%)
- Peak crash times: 8-9am, 5-6pm (commute hours)

**User Feedback**:
- "App freezes during checkout" (mentioned in 23 reviews)
- "Too slow compared to website" (15 support tickets)
- NPS for mobile: 28 vs desktop: 45

**Competitive Analysis**:
- Competitor A: Crash rate <0.3%, load time 1.5s
- Competitor B: Recently launched "lightning fast" mobile app
- Industry standard: <0.5% crash rate, <2s load time

**Business Impact**:
- Est. $120K/month lost revenue from mobile conversion gap
- Customer support cost: $8K/month on mobile-related tickets
- Churn risk: 12% of mobile users downgrade to occasional use

## What We Should Research

### Open Questions

**Technical**:
- [ ] What's causing the Android 12 crashes specifically?
- [ ] Are image optimization techniques sufficient?
- [ ] Can we implement code splitting to reduce bundle size?
- [ ] What's the feasibility of React Native vs native rebuild?

**User Behavior**:
- [ ] Do users retry after crashes or abandon permanently?
- [ ] What's the tolerance threshold for load times before abandonment?
- [ ] Are certain user segments more affected?
- [ ] What features do mobile users value most?

**Business**:
- [ ] What's the CAC (customer acquisition cost) for mobile users?
- [ ] How does mobile LTV compare to desktop?
- [ ] Would improving mobile performance unlock new market segments?
- [ ] What's the competitive urgency (are we losing deals to competitors)?

### Validation Plan

1. **Technical Audit** (Week 1)
   - Deep dive into crash logs
   - Performance profiling on target devices
   - Code review of critical paths

2. **User Research** (Week 2)
   - 10 user interviews with mobile-heavy users
   - Usability testing on slow connections
   - Survey 100+ mobile users on pain points

3. **Competitive Benchmarking** (Week 1)
   - Test top 3 competitors' mobile apps
   - Document performance metrics
   - Identify best practices

4. **Business Case** (Week 3)
   - Calculate revenue opportunity
   - Estimate engineering effort
   - Build ROI model

## Solution Ideas

### Option 1: Targeted Optimization (Quick Wins)
**Approach**: Fix critical bugs, optimize images, reduce bundle size

**Pros**:
- Fast to implement (4-6 weeks)
- Low risk
- Immediate impact on worst issues

**Cons**:
- May not solve underlying architecture issues
- Temporary fix

**Effort**: Medium (1 eng, 6 weeks)  
**Impact**: +10-15% improvement

---

### Option 2: React Native Upgrade
**Approach**: Upgrade to latest React Native, implement performance best practices

**Pros**:
- Addresses root cause
- Keeps existing codebase
- Unlocks future optimizations

**Cons**:
- Risky (could introduce new bugs)
- Requires regression testing

**Effort**: High (2 eng, 10 weeks)  
**Impact**: +30-40% improvement

---

### Option 3: Native Rebuild
**Approach**: Rebuild critical paths (checkout, search) in native code

**Pros**:
- Maximum performance gains
- Best user experience
- Future-proof

**Cons**:
- Expensive (12-16 weeks)
- Maintains two codebases
- Higher maintenance cost

**Effort**: Very High (3 eng, 16 weeks)  
**Impact**: +50-60% improvement

---

### Option 4: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
**Approach**: Option 1 immediately + Option 2 in parallel

**Pros**:
- Quick wins while addressing root cause
- De-risks major upgrade
- Shows progress to users and stakeholders

**Cons**:
- Requires coordination
- Some duplicate effort

**Effort**: High (2 eng, 8 weeks)  
**Impact**: +25-35% improvement in 6 weeks, +40-50% by week 12

## Risks

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Upgrade breaks existing features | High | Medium | Comprehensive testing, phased rollout |
| Performance gains less than expected | Medium | Low | Benchmark early, adjust approach |

| User expectations not met | High | Low | Set realistic expectations, communicate progress |
| Competitive pressure during development | Medium | Medium | Quick wins first, fast follow improvements |

### Execution Risks
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Engineering capacity constraints | High | Medium | Start with Option 1, add resources for Option 2 |
| Scope creep | Medium | High | Strict definition of done, phased approach |
| Timeline slips | Medium | Medium | Weekly checkpoints, clear milestones |

## Questions to Validate

### Must Answer Before Committing
1. **Is this the highest ROI opportunity?** Compare to other P1 initiatives
2. **Do we have engineering capacity?** Check with eng leadership
3. **What's the competitive urgency?** Are we actively losing deals?
4. **Can we measure success accurately?** Ensure analytics are in place

### Should Answer During Execution
5. **Are users noticing improvements?** Set up feedback mechanism
6. **Is the technical approach working?** Weekly performance reviews
7. **Are we on budget/timeline?** Biweekly project reviews
8. **Should we expand scope?** Evaluate at 50% completion

### Nice to Answer
9. **Can we productize learnings?** (blog post, case study)
10. **What other areas need similar improvements?** (web, desktop)

3. **Week 3**: Kickoff execution (Option 4 hybrid approach)
4. **Week 4-6**: Quick wins implementation + RN upgrade starts
5. **Week 7-12**: RN upgrade completion + measurement

### If Deferred (P2/P3)
