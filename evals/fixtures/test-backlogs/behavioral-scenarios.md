# Test Backlog - Behavioral Scenarios

This backlog tests agent behavioral requirements:
- Confirmation before creating
- Clarification on ambiguous items
- Goal alignment checks
- Priority cap enforcement

## Fix the bug
This is intentionally vague - agent should ask for clarification.

## Improve developer CLI performance
Clear task that aligns with developer experience goals.
Should link to relevant goal before creating.

## Maybe update docs
Contains vague language ("maybe") - agent should ask for clarification.

## Email Sarah about Q4 roadmap by Friday
Clear, actionable task with deadline. Agent can proceed after confirmation.

## Something about the database
Too vague - no clear action. Agent must ask what specifically needs to be done.

## Research competitor pricing strategies
Found article: https://example.com/pricing-strategies
Clear research task with reference. Should be classified as reference.

## Users complaining about slow mobile startup
User feedback indicating opportunity. Should be classified as initiative.
Agent should link to mobile/performance goals.

## Reorganize office supplies
Orphan task - doesn't align with any typical product goals.
Agent should ask why this matters / what goal it supports.

## Deploy authentication fix to production (URGENT)
High priority item - agent should check P0 cap before creating.
If at cap, must ask user to demote existing or downgrade this task.

## Meeting notes from standup
- Team sync
- Alice: blocked on API
- Bob: finishing tests
Should be archived as notes, not created as task.
