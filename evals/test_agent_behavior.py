"""
Agent Behavioral Requirement Tests

Tests that the agent follows behavioral requirements from AGENTS.md and workflows:
- Present findings for user review before creating anything
- Wait for user confirmation before creating tasks/initiatives
- Link tasks to goals from GOALS.md
- Ask for clarification on ambiguous items
- Follow interaction style guidelines

These tests validate behavioral contracts, not just function outputs.

Run with: pytest evals/test_agent_behavior.py -v
