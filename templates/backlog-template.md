# Backlog Example

Example of how to use BACKLOG.md for capturing raw ideas.

---

## How It Works

1. **Brain dump** - Add ideas, requests, bugs, tasks, notes, references - everything goes here
2. **Process daily/weekly** - Say: `"process my backlog"` or `/backlog`
3. **AI categorizes** - Items become:
   - **Opportunities** → `knowledge/opportunities/` folder (strategic ideas to explore)
   - **Tasks** → `tasks/` folder (actionable items)
   - **References** → `knowledge/references/` (useful info)
   - **Uncategorized** → Archived in `knowledge/notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (meeting notes, random thoughts)
4. **Review** - Adjust priorities and add details

## Format Options

### Minimal (Fastest)
```
- Add dark mode
- Fix mobile checkout bug
- Enterprise SSO for Acme deal
```

### Structured (Recommended)
```
## Feature Name
- Source: Who/where it came from
- Context: Brief description
- Why now: Urgency or timing
```

### Voice Note Style
```
## Meeting with Sarah - Enterprise Features
Customer wants SSO, RBAC, audit logs. Deal is $500K ARR. 
Timeline: Need decision by end of Q1. Competitor offers this.
Engineering says 6-8 weeks for SSO, rest can wait.
