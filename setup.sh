# Goals

Define your personal and business goals here. AI will use these to align task priorities and recommendations.

---

## How to Use This File

1. Define 3-5 quarterly goals (too many = unfocused)
2. Update quarterly or when priorities shift
3. AI references this during:
   - Weekly reviews (goal progress tracking)
   - Daily planning (priority alignment)
   - Backlog processing (strategic task categorization)

**Tip**: Make goals specific and measurable. Vague goals get vague results.
