## What Makes a Good Persona

Effective personas are:
- **Research-based**: Grounded in actual user data, not assumptions
- **Specific**: Concrete details that bring the person to life
- **Actionable**: Help teams make better product decisions
- **Memorable**: Easy to reference in conversations
- **Representative**: Reflect real user segments, not edge cases

## Persona Components

### 1. Core Identity

**Name & Role**
- Give a realistic name (helps humanize)
- Job title and company context
- Years of experience in role

**Demographics** (only if relevant)
- Include only if it affects product usage
- Avoid stereotyping

### 2. Goals & Motivations

**Primary Goals**
- What are they trying to achieve?
- What does success look like?

**Motivations**
- Why do these goals matter to them?
- What drives their behavior?

**Example:**
- **Goal**: Reduce time spent on weekly reporting from 4 hours to 1 hour
- **Motivation**: Free up time for strategic analysis; reduce repetitive work

### 3. Pain Points & Frustrations

**Current Challenges**
- What problems do they face?
- What makes their job difficult?
- Where do they get stuck?

**Quote these directly from research**
- Use verbatim language from interviews
- Capture emotional tone

### 4. Behaviors & Workflows

**How They Work**
- Typical workflows and processes
- Tools they currently use
- Workarounds they've created
- Frequency of key tasks

**Tech Savviness**
- Comfort level with technology
- Learning preferences
- Adoption patterns

### 5. Context & Constraints

**Environment**
- Team size and structure
- Reporting relationships
- Budget authority
- Decision-making power

**Constraints**
- Time limitations
- Resource restrictions
- Political/organizational barriers
- Compliance or security requirements

## Creating Personas from Research

### Step 1: Segment Users

Review research and group users by:
- Similar goals and needs
- Comparable workflows
- Shared pain points
- Usage patterns

Aim for 2-4 distinct personas (more becomes unwieldy).

### Step 2: Composite Creation

For each segment:
- Combine insights from multiple users
- Create a composite that represents the group
- Don't base on a single individual
- Ensure each persona is distinct from others

### Step 3: Bring to Life

Add specific details:
- Quote real user statements
- Describe a "day in the life"
- Include contextual details that make them memorable
- Use a photo or illustration (optional)

### Step 4: Validate

Check that each persona:
- Is backed by research data
- Represents a meaningful user segment
- Helps inform product decisions
- Doesn't overlap significantly with other personas
