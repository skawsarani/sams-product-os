# User Research Analysis Framework

## Analysis Process

### 1. Initial Review

Read through all research materials to understand the scope and context:
- Scan transcripts for general themes
- Note recurring topics or phrases
- Identify the types of users interviewed
- Understand the research questions being explored

### 2. Theme Extraction

Systematically identify patterns across interviews:

**Look for:**
- Recurring pain points or frustrations
- Common workflows or behaviors
- Desired features or improvements
- Emotional responses (excitement, confusion, anger)
- Unexpected insights or contradictions

**Extraction method:**
- Quote verbatim when possible (with source reference)
- Group similar statements together
- Count frequency of mentions (high/medium/low)
- Note intensity of sentiment

### 3. Categorization

Organize findings into actionable categories:

**Standard categories:**
- **Pain Points**: Problems users experience
- **Feature Requests**: Specific asks or suggestions
- **Workflow Patterns**: How users accomplish tasks
- **Usability Issues**: UI/UX friction points
- **Jobs to be Done**: Underlying goals users are trying to achieve
- **Workarounds**: Creative solutions users have invented
- **Delighters**: Positive surprises or loved features
- **Competitive Insights**: What users say about alternatives

### 4. Insight Generation

Transform observations into actionable insights:

**Good insight format:**
- **Observation**: What users said/did (with quotes)
- **Implication**: What this means for the product
- **Recommendation**: Suggested next steps or opportunities
- **Priority Signal**: Based on frequency, intensity, alignment with strategy

**Example:**
- **Observation**: 7/10 users mentioned manually copying data between tools, calling it "tedious" and "error-prone"
- **Implication**: Data integration is a significant pain point costing users time
- **Recommendation**: Explore API integrations with top 3 mentioned tools
- **Priority**: High (frequent + intense pain + strategic fit)

### 5. Pattern Analysis

Look for higher-order patterns:

- **Segment differences**: Do different user types have different needs?
- **Context dependencies**: When/where do behaviors occur?
- **Causal relationships**: What triggers certain behaviors?
- **Missing features**: What capabilities are users forced to find elsewhere?
- **Adoption barriers**: What prevents users from using features?

## Quoting Best Practices

- Always attribute quotes to specific interviews (e.g., "Interview 2023-12-15 with Sarah")
- Use [...] for removed context within quotes
- Maintain user's exact language for authenticity
- Note tone/emotion in brackets when relevant (e.g., [frustrated], [excited])

## Red Flags in Analysis

Watch out for:
- **Leading questions**: Discount insights from biased interview questions
- **Sample bias**: Note if all participants are similar (power users, etc.)
- **Recency bias**: Recent interviews may overweight current events
- **Confirmation bias**: Challenge your own assumptions
- **Outliers**: Distinguish edge cases from common patterns
