## Core Principles

### 1. Evidence-Based Analysis
- Every claim must trace to a source
- Distinguish facts from assumptions
- Quote verbatim for customer feedback
- Note conflicting information from different sources

### 2. Multi-Source Validation
- Cross-reference information across sources
- Web claims vs. customer reviews vs. analyst reports
- Flag single-source claims (may be marketing spin)
- Prioritize primary sources (customer reviews) over secondary (blog posts)

### 3. Objectivity
- Avoid confirmation bias (don't just look for weaknesses)
- Include both strengths and weaknesses
- Don't dismiss competitor strengths as "marketing fluff"
- Be honest about gaps in our own product

### 4. Freshness Assessment
- Always note when information was published
- Pricing from 2 years ago may be outdated
- Company size/funding changes frequently
- Re-research major competitors every 3-6 months

## Source Credibility Framework

### High Credibility (Trust and Use)
- **Primary sources**: Competitor's official website, pricing page
- **Customer reviews**: G2, Capterra, TrustRadius (verified buyers)
- **User-generated**: Reddit discussions, Stack Overflow, Hacker News
- **Official announcements**: Blog posts, press releases from competitor
- **Analyst reports**: Gartner, Forrester (if available)

### Medium Credibility (Use with Caution)
- **Blog posts**: May be dated or biased
- **News articles**: Fact-check claims
- **Comparison sites**: May have affiliate incentives
- **Social media**: Anecdotal, but useful for sentiment

### Low Credibility (Verify Elsewhere)
- **Competitor's marketing materials**: Likely optimistic claims
- **Unverified testimonials**: May be cherry-picked
- **Outdated sources**: >12 months old without confirmation
- **Anonymous sources**: No way to verify

---

## Feature Extraction Methods

### From Product Pages
Look for:
- **Feature lists**: Often in tabs, sections, or comparison tables
- **Screenshots**: Visual evidence of capabilities
- **Integration logos**: What they integrate with
- **Technical docs**: API capabilities, limits, architecture

**How to extract**:
1. Start with main product page
2. Check "Features" or "Product" navigation
3. Look for comparison pages (they list everything)
4. Read technical documentation for depth
5. Watch product demo videos if available

**Red flags**:
- Vague claims like "industry-leading" without specifics
- Missing details on limitations
- No pricing on feature-heavy pages (may be expensive)

### From Customer Reviews
Look for:
- **Feature mentions**: "The [feature] is great because..."
- **Feature complaints**: "I wish they had [feature]"
- **Use case stories**: How customers actually use the product
- **Workarounds**: Features that exist but are clunky

**How to extract**:
1. Read 10-15 reviews (mix of positive and negative)
2. Note recurring themes
3. Filter by user role (e.g., "Product Manager" reviews)
4. Check review dates (old reviews may reference deprecated features)
5. Look for "Cons" sections explicitly

**Red flags**:
- All 5-star reviews (may be incentivized)
- Suspiciously similar language (may be fake)
- Reviews from "trial users" (limited exposure)

## Pricing Analysis Framework

### Information to Gather
1. **Tier names**: Free, Starter, Pro, Enterprise, etc.
2. **Tier costs**: $X/month or $X/user/month
3. **What's included per tier**: Feature list by tier
4. **Free trial**: Duration, credit card required, limitations
5. **Discounts**: Annual (usually 20%), volume, non-profit
6. **Hidden costs**: Setup fees, overage charges, support costs
7. **Custom pricing**: When they say "Contact Sales"

### Where to Find Pricing
- **Primary**: Competitor's /pricing page
- **Secondary**: Comparison sites may have data
- **Tertiary**: Customer reviews may mention costs
- **Last resort**: Ask in communities (Reddit, Slack groups)

### Pricing Red Flags
- **No pricing listed**: Enterprise-only or very expensive
- **"Starting at"**: Usually much more for useful features
- **"Custom"**: Negotiate heavily, price varies widely
- **Per-seat AND usage-based**: Can get expensive fast

### How to Analyze Pricing
1. **Positioning**: Are they premium, mid-market, or budget?
2. **Value metric**: Per-user? Per-transaction? Flat-rate?
3. **Feature gating**: What's locked behind higher tiers?
4. **Comparison**: How do they compare to market average?

## Testimonial & Review Analysis

### Finding Testimonials

**Positive testimonials**:
- Competitor's website (customer page, case studies)
- G2/Capterra (filtered by 4-5 stars)
- LinkedIn recommendations
- Customer success stories (blog posts)

**Critical feedback**:
- G2/Capterra (filtered by 1-3 stars)
- Reddit (search "[Competitor] vs" or "[Competitor] review")
- Hacker News discussions
- Twitter/X complaints
- Public support forums

### Extraction Rules

**Always include**:
- Verbatim quote (never paraphrase)
- Attribution (who said it, their role if known)
- Source (G2, Capterra, Reddit, etc.)
- Date (when was it published)

**Example format**:
> "Feature X completely transformed our workflow. We were able to reduce processing time by 50%."
> — Sarah J., Product Manager @ Tech Co (G2 Review, Jan 2026)

### Analysis Framework

**For positive feedback**, answer:
- What specific feature/aspect do they praise?
- Why does it matter to them (the "why" behind the praise)?
- What's the outcome/benefit they achieved?
- Is this unique to this competitor or table stakes?

**For critical feedback**, answer:
- What specific pain point or limitation?
- How significant is the impact (showstopper vs. annoyance)?
- Is there a workaround or is it unsolvable?
- Is this a one-off complaint or recurring theme?

## Identifying Strengths

Strengths are **competitive advantages** that make customers choose this competitor.

### Categories of Strengths
1. **Product superiority**: Features others don't have
2. **Brand/trust**: Market leader, established reputation
3. **Ecosystem**: Integrations, marketplace, community
4. **Pricing**: More affordable or better value
5. **Service**: Support, onboarding, customer success
6. **Scale**: Handles larger customers, more volume
7. **Ease of use**: Simpler, more intuitive
8. **Specialization**: Deep expertise in niche

### How to Identify
- Read positive reviews and note WHY customers chose them
- Check comparison pages: what do they emphasize?
- Look at case studies: what problems do they solve?
- Analyze market position: are they #1, #2, or niche leader?

### Avoid False Strengths
- Don't confuse marketing claims with real strengths
- "Industry-leading" without evidence = not a strength
- Validate claims with customer reviews

---

## Identifying Weaknesses & Gaps

Weaknesses are **disadvantages** that make customers consider alternatives.

### Categories of Weaknesses
1. **Feature gaps**: Missing capabilities competitors have
2. **Pricing**: Too expensive or confusing model
3. **Scalability**: Can't handle large customers
4. **Reliability**: Downtime, bugs, performance issues
5. **Support**: Slow response, poor documentation
6. **Ease of use**: Steep learning curve
7. **Integration**: Limited integrations
8. **Specialization**: Jack-of-all-trades, master of none

### How to Identify
- Read negative reviews (1-3 stars on G2/Capterra)
- Search Reddit for "[Competitor] problems" or "[Competitor] vs"
- Check competitor's public roadmap (gaps = what they're fixing)
- Compare feature lists with market leaders (what's missing?)

### Translate to Opportunities
For each weakness, ask: **How can we capitalize on this?**
- Their weakness = our opportunity
- Their missing feature = our differentiator
- Their support issues = our service advantage

**Format**:
- **Weakness**: [Describe the gap/limitation]
- **Evidence**: [Quote or data point]
- **Opportunity for us**: [How we can use this strategically]

## Positioning Analysis

Understand how the competitor positions themselves in the market.

### What to Look For
1. **Tagline/Value Prop**: How do they describe themselves? (e.g., "The all-in-one platform for...")
2. **Target persona**: Who are they speaking to? (e.g., "Built for enterprise teams")
3. **Key messaging themes**: What do they emphasize repeatedly?
4. **Differentiation**: How do they say they're different from alternatives?
5. **Visual positioning**: Premium (clean, minimal) vs. accessible (colorful, friendly)?

### Where to Find Positioning
- Homepage hero section
- About page
- Product page headlines
- LinkedIn/Twitter bio
- Ad copy (search their name + "ads" to find ad examples)

### Analysis Questions
- **Who is their ideal customer?** (Company size, industry, role)
- **What job are they hired to do?** (What problem do they solve?)
- **How do they differentiate?** (Why choose them over alternatives?)
- **Is positioning consistent with reality?** (Do customers agree?)

## Data Freshness Assessment

Not all data ages equally. Assess freshness for each category:

### High Decay (Check Often)
- **Pricing**: Changes frequently, check every 3-6 months
- **Features**: Products evolve, re-research every 6 months
- **Company size/funding**: Check annually or after news

### Medium Decay (Check Periodically)
- **Target customers**: May shift over time, check annually
- **Positioning**: Usually stable but evolves, check annually
- **Market position**: Changes with new entrants, check annually

### Low Decay (Check Rarely)
- **Company founding/background**: Stable, update only if major change
- **Core value prop**: Usually stable over years

### How to Flag Outdated Information
- Note date of source: *(Source: [URL], accessed Jan 2026)*
- If source is >6 months old, note: *(May be outdated - re-verify)*
- If pricing is old, note: *(Pricing as of [Date] - verify current pricing)*

**Fix**: Be objective - acknowledge where they excel

### ❌ Mistake 4: Outdated Data
**Why bad**: Making decisions on old information
**Fix**: Always check and note dates

### ❌ Mistake 5: Single-Source Claims
**Why bad**: May be inaccurate or biased
**Fix**: Validate important claims across 2-3 sources

### ❌ Mistake 6: Superficial Analysis
**Why bad**: Doesn't provide strategic insights
**Fix**: Don't just list features - analyze what they mean

### ❌ Mistake 7: Confirmation Bias
**Why bad**: Only finding weaknesses you already believed
**Fix**: Actively look for both strengths AND weaknesses
