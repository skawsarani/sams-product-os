## Instructions
You are being asked to write a stakeholder update. These are comprehensive project status reports designed for executives, leadership teams, and key stakeholders who need detailed visibility into project health, progress, and blockers.

Unlike quick 3P updates (30-60 seconds), stakeholder updates are deeper dives meant to be read in 5-10 minutes. They provide strategic context, milestone tracking, risk management, and clear asks for decision-making.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Audience**: Executive team, leadership, cross-functional stakeholders, or board members
- **Frequency**: Weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly (less frequent than 3Ps)
- **Length**: Comprehensive but scannable - use headers, tables, and status indicators
- **Purpose**: Enable informed decision-making, surface blockers early, track strategic alignment

## Before Writing

Gather the following information:
1. **Project/Product name** - What are you updating on?
2. **Audience** - Who is this for? (Executive team, leadership, cross-functional, stakeholders)
3. **Frequency** - How often is this sent? (Weekly, bi-weekly, monthly)
4. **Time period covered** - What dates does this update cover?
5. **Overall status** - Is the project on track, at risk, or blocked?

## Tools Available

Whenever possible, try to pull from available sources:
- **Project management tools**: Jira, Linear, Asana for milestone tracking, completion rates
- **Analytics**: Metrics dashboards, product analytics for key performance data
- **Meeting notes**: Recent stakeholder meetings, decision logs
- **Calendar**: Upcoming milestones, decision deadlines
- **Slack/Email**: Team updates, blocker discussions, wins to highlight
- **Knowledge base**: `knowledge/product-strategy/` for strategic alignment
- **Knowledge base**: `knowledge/product-analytics/` for metrics and KPIs
- **Knowledge base**: `knowledge/opportunities/` for strategic opportunities
- **Knowledge base**: `initiatives/` for initiatives and related work
- **Knowledge base**: `tasks/` for in-progress and upcoming work

If you don't have access to these sources, ask the user for:
- Key accomplishments this period
- Current blockers or risks
- Upcoming milestones and their status
- Decisions that need to be made
- Specific asks or support needed

## Workflow

1. **Clarify context**: Confirm project name, audience, frequency, and time period
2. **Determine status**: Assess overall health (on track, at risk, blocked)
3. **Gather data**: Use available tools or ask user for key information
4. **Structure the update**: Follow the formatting template below
5. **Prioritize clarity**: Use status indicators, tables, and clear sections
6. **Highlight asks**: Make decisions needed and support requests crystal clear

## Formatting

Use the following structure. Adapt sections based on what's most relevant:

---

## Writing Tips

1. **Lead with status**: Make it immediately clear if things are on track, at risk, or blocked
2. **Use visual indicators**: Emojis and status symbols make updates scannable
3. **Be specific with numbers**: Use concrete metrics over vague descriptions
4. **Highlight wins**: Celebrate team achievements and progress
5. **Make asks actionable**: Be clear about what you need and when
6. **Keep it scannable**: Use tables, bullets, and clear headers
7. **Focus on decisions**: Surface decisions that need stakeholder input
8. **Contextualize blockers**: Explain impact and what you're doing about them
9. **Balance detail with brevity**: Comprehensive but not overwhelming
10. **Adapt sections**: Skip sections that aren't relevant for this update

## Tone Guidelines

- **Direct and factual**: Present data and status clearly
- **Action-oriented**: Focus on what's happening and what's next
- **Transparent about risks**: Don't hide problems, surface them early
- **Solutions-focused**: When presenting blockers, include mitigation plans
- **Respectful of time**: Make it easy for busy executives to scan and find what matters
